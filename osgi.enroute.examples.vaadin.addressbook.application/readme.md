# OSGI ENROUTE EXAMPLES VAADIN ADDRESSBOOK APPLICATION

A small example that takes the gist of the Vaadin Address book demo and demonstrates how this can be done wiht OSGi enRoute.

This example was kindly donated by Paul Fraser.

## Changes

The example is different from the original in the following ways:

* Uses DTO instead of bean
* Uses instances of static class name  based creation
